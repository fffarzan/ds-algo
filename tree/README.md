- Similar to doubled linked list (left child and right child of a parent node).
- We can't have any cylces in binary trees.
- Child Node / parent Node / Sibling Node
- Leaf Node: A The last child that hasn't any children.
- Root Node: The most top parent node.
- Decendant Nodes: Any nodes beneath of a special node to leaf nodes.
- Ancestor Nodes: Any nodes of parent chain of a special node to root node.
- Height: The number of nodes going down from a special node to a leaf node.
- Depth: The number of nodes going up from a spcial node to root node.
