# Backtracking

- It's based on DFS algorithm.
- It's based on binary tree, not BST.
- It's so similar to maze problem.
- It's a kind of brute force algorithm, meaning we should try every possible way to find the solution.

## Time Complexity

- O(n) if we have to track all the possibilaties in the maze.

### Problem

Determine if a path exists from the root of the tree to a leaf node. It may not contains any zeroes.
