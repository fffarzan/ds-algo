# Data Structure
Way of structuring data inside of RAM.

## RAM
 - A block of RAM is created by: Value + Address
 - The data storing in the RAM will be contiguous and next together. The address will be incremented by 4 (in number) because our systems are 32 bits by default.
 - Note that for storing characters we just need 1 byte (for ASCIIs) so our Addrees in RAM with be incremented by 1.
