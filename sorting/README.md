# Sorting
-  It breaks the problem into several sub problems. For example, solve first two elements of the array sorted, then first three elements sorted and so on.
- We can solve it using recursion.
- Stable Sorting: Preserve the original order of elements. For example if you have two 7 in your array, it will arrange it 7s as the order of original.
Unstable Sorting: There is no garantee to keep original order (opposite of above).

# Insertion Sorting

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O((n ^ 2) / 2)
